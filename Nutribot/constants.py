To begin, please follow these simple setup steps:

Choose your compost tank 
ü™£ This can be a bin, bucket, or container with airflow. Make sure it is placed in a ventilated spot, either indoors or outdoors.

Add a base layer of soil
üå± Soil helps with microbial activity and provides a healthy environment for decomposition.

Introduce your composting worms
ü™± Worms help break down food faster and improve compost quality. Red wigglers are the most common composting worms."""
